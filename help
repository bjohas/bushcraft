Finding the IP address of the Raspberry Pi
==========================================

There are a number of ways to find the IP address of the Rpi. All of these
presume that the Rpi is able to configure an IP for itself using the DHCP
service (for example, the DHCP service can be abled by configuring 'Connection
Sharing' in Network Manager.

1. Use the 'ippi' command from bushcraft.
-----------------------------------------

user@workstation:~$ ippi
10.42.0.97

The output of this command can be used in scripts, eg:

user@workstation:~$ ssh pi@`ippi`

to login to the rpi with SSH.


2. Listen to the IP address on the headphone socket
---------------------------------------------------

When the Rpi is booted but no user is logged in the it's IP address can be heard read out on the headphone socket.

Listen to the address being read out and write it down.

The IP address is read out in four groups separated by a dot, each group consists of a three digit number. The number in each group must be between 0 and 254. 

If a user is logged into the device the IP Address is no longer read out.


3. Install mDNS service (Avahi)
-------------------------------

The mDNS service can allow automatic discovery and DNS resolution of domains on a local network.

On the Rasbperry Pi:
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install libnss-mdns

On the connected computer:
	sudo apt-get install avahi-discover

If the hostname of the Rpi is 'raspberrypi' it should be possible to resolve
the IP address of the Rpi from the workstation.

Use the GUI tool 'Avahi Zeroconf Browser' or the following command to find the IP address:

user@workstation: getent hosts raspberrypi.local
10.42.0.97      raspberrypi.local

or SSH into it directly using the DNS name:

user@workstation: ssh pi@raspberry.local

Note that mDNS resoltion will only work when both devices are on the same local
network (it might not work if the Rpi is plugged into the ethernet port of a
wireless access point you are connected to).
