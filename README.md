bushcraft
=========

A set of tools for remote support of linux computers, with some special bits for Raspberry Pi.

The files in the config directory need to be updated to your requirements.

You install bushcraft by retrieving http://tiny.cc/bush, e.g.

    wget tiny.cc/bush
or

    curl tiny.cc/bush

(omitted http:// in order to type as little as possible). and then running:

    perl bush
    
which fetches the rest of the tools, and installs further packages.
